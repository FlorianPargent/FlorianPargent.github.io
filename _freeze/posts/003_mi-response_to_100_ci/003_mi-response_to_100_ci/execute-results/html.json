I show by simulation that in this case, it can be better to only use the measurement-invariant measure when controlling for the latent confounder.\n:::\n\n## Reproduce Julia Rohrer's simulated scenario\n\nBefore playing around with alternative scenarios, I wanted to reproduce JR's simulation results to make sure that we are on the same page.\nI reprogrammed her simulation based on the DAG in the original [blog post](https://www.the100.ci/2025/10/13/if-you-have-two-measures-of-the-same-confounder-you-can-just-include-both-of-them-in-your-regression-model/), fitted linear models controlling either for both measures of the confound or only for the indicator with the highest loading on the latent confounder (*Covariate 2*).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nR <- 10000\nn <- 200\nset.seed(42)\nsim1 <- replicate(R, expr = {\n  true_confound <- rnorm(n)\n  X <- 0.5*true_confound + rnorm(n)\n  Y <- 1*true_confound + 0.3*X + rnorm(n)\n  covariate1 <- 1*true_confound + rnorm(n)\n  covariate2 <- 2*true_confound + rnorm(n)\n  mod_ctrl_both <- lm(Y ~ X + covariate1 + covariate2)\n  mod_ctrl_cov2 <- lm(Y ~ X + covariate2)\n  c(est_ctrl_both = coef(mod_ctrl_both)[\"X\"],\n    est_ctrl_cov2 = coef(mod_ctrl_cov2)[\"X\"])})\n\nM_est_ctrl_both_sim1 <- mean(sim1[\"est_ctrl_both.X\",])\nM_est_ctrl_cov2_sim1 <- mean(sim1[\"est_ctrl_cov2.X\",])\nRMSE_ctrl_both_sim1 <- sqrt(mean((sim1[\"est_ctrl_both.X\",] - 0.3)^2))\nRMSE_ctrl_cov2_sim1 <- sqrt(mean((sim1[\"est_ctrl_cov2.X\",] - 0.3)^2))\n```\n:::\n\n\nMy estimates are very similar to the original blog post:  \nThe average estimate for the causal effect of *X* on *Y* from the model controlling for both measures ($M_{est} = 0.380$) is closer to the true value of 0.3 than the estimate from the model controlling only for *Covariate 2* ($M_{est} = 0.395$). The RMSE values are also very similar to JR's results with $RMSE = 0.110$ when controlling for both and $RMSE = 0.122$ when controlling only for *Covariate 2*.\n\n## Simulate extended scenario in which measurement invariance does not hold for Covariate 1\n\nI have recently thought a lot about causal perspectives on measurement invariance [@sterner_2024], and I know that JR has also worked on that topic [@rohrer_2025].\nSo when I read JR's blog post (which focused on multicollinearity and not measurement invariance), I was immediately asking myself under which circumstances the recommendation to control for both covariates would not be valid.\nMy intuition was that for measures of the true confounder that are not measurement-invariant (i.e., indicators that are also causally affected by other variables than the latent confounder), it should be possible to construct scenarios in which the non-invariant measures should better not be used to control for the confounder.\n\nOne interesting scenario I came up with is when a measure of the *True confound* is also causally affected by the treatment.\nIn JR's toy example, *X* is math self-concept, *Y* is school grades, and the *True confound* is cognitive abilities.\nA (hopefully) somewhat plausible case based on the original example might be that *Covariate 1* is a numeric power test from an IQ test battery (i.e., a test in which participants have no time limit to complete rather difficult tasks).\nIn contrast, *Covariate 2* is a non-numeric speed test from the same IQ test battery (i.e., a test in which participants must complete as many rather simple tasks as possible in limited time).\nFor the sake of the argument, let's assume that because the test represented by *Covariate 2* does not look like a math problem, the score will not be directly affected by the participants' math self-concept.\nHowever, the test represented by *Covariate 1* looks like a math problem, thus participants with a low math self-concept get discouraged, tend to give up early to find the right solution, and achieve lower test scores.\n\nIn line with this hypothetical scenario, I have simulated data according to the extended data-generating process displayed in @fig-1.\n\n![Extended DAG adapted from [JR's blog post ](https://www.the100.ci/2025/10/13/if-you-have-two-measures-of-the-same-confounder-you-can-just-include-both-of-them-in-your-regression-model/) (figure copied from the original post; changes marked in red).

The RMSE values are now $RMSE = 0.210$ when controlling for both and $RMSE = 0.122$ when controlling only for *Covariate 2*.\n\n## Rethink recommendation to control for all available measures of a latent confounder\n\nWith the extended data-generating process, JR's blog title ...\n\n> If you have two measures of the same confounder, you can just include both of them in your regression model\n\n... seems not always to be good advice. Instead, it might be better to only control for \"clean\" measurement-invariant measures of the *True confound*, which in my scenario is *Covariate 2*.\n\nHowever, whether controlling for both measures actually yields a worse result than only controlling for *Covariate 2* depends on the actual size of all path coefficients in the data-generating process. That is because in the current DAG, the estimate for the causal effect of *X* on *Y* is biased for two different reasons:\nOn the one hand, we have \"measurement bias\", because we must control for the *True confound* but can only do so using imperfect indicators (*Covariates 1 and 2*).\nAs long as we have only measurement-invariant indicators (like in the original scenario), using more of them in our regression model should be a good idea because we then measure the confounder more accurately. \nOn the other hand, we have \"selection bias\" because controlling for the not measurement-invariant *Covariate 1* opens a colliding path (*X -> Covariate 1 <- True confound -> Y*; similar to model 16 in @cinelli_2024).\nBecause both biases are present, whenever some indicators are not measurement-invariant, the optimal control strategy would depend on the actual size of the path coefficients because we can construct edge cases, in which both biases cancel each other out:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nR <- 10000\nn <- 200\nset.seed(42)\nsim3 <- replicate(R, expr = {\n  true_confound <- rnorm(n)\n  X <- 0.5*true_confound + rnorm(n)\n  Y <- 1*true_confound + 0.3*X + rnorm(n)\n  covariate1 <- 1*true_confound + 0.5*X + rnorm(n) # cancel out both biases with 0.5*X\n  covariate2 <- 2*true_confound + rnorm(n)\n  mod_ctrl_both <- lm(Y ~ X + covariate1 + covariate2)\n  mod_ctrl_cov2 <- lm(Y ~ X + covariate2)\n  c(est_ctrl_both = coef(mod_ctrl_both)[\"X\"],\n    est_ctrl_cov2 = coef(mod_ctrl_cov2)[\"X\"])})\n\nM_est_ctrl_both_sim3 <- mean(sim3[\"est_ctrl_both.X\",])\nM_est_ctrl_cov2_sim3 <- mean(sim3[\"est_ctrl_cov2.X\",])\nRMSE_ctrl_both_sim3 <- sqrt(mean((sim3[\"est_ctrl_both.X\",] - 0.3)^2))\nRMSE_ctrl_cov2_sim3 <- sqrt(mean((sim3[\"est_ctrl_cov2.X\",] - 0.3)^2))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn our example, if we set the problematic path (*X -> Covariate 1*) to 0.5, the regression model controlling for both measures would estimate the causal effect of 0.3 almost perfectly ($M_{est} = 0.299$), but this would more or less be a coincidence.\nIn a real application, we do not know the actual size of the path coefficients and can thus not determine whether including the non-invariant measure would be a good idea.\n\nTo sum up, I think a better recommendation would be something like:\n\n> If you have multiple measures of the same confounder, think hard about which measures might not be measurement-invariant (i.e., could be affected by the treatment or the outcome in your specific application), and include as many of the measurement-invariant ones in your regression model as possible.\n\nOf course, as also mentioned in JR's post, we could always go one step further and try to test or specify violations of measurement invariance in a structural equation model [@sterner_2024].\n\nIn closing, I want to stress that JR never claimed to provide general advice. I very much liked the original post (like most entries on *The 100% CI* blog) and I totally agree that traditional statistics education places a wrong emphasis on multicollinearity, while we should put a stronger focus on causal inference.\n",
