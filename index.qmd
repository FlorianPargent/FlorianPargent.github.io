:::{#about}

I am a **psychologist and statistician** who teaches statistical methods, research methods, questionnaire development, and assessment to psychology students at **LMU Munich**. In my research, I try to introduce sophisticated statistical methods to psychological researchers and use these methods in applied work. I try my best to publish reproducible analysis code, provide or use open data, and convince my co-authors to publish preprints and choose journals with more sustainable open access policies.

My main **research interests** lie in the following areas:

- (Bayesian) Generative Modeling
- (Bayesian) Item Response Theory
- (Bayesian) Decision Theory
- Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning
- Questionnaire Development
- Response Styles in Questionnaires
- Applied Research
